✈️ Airline Customer Satisfaction Predictor

🚀 Overview

This project aims to predict flight customer satisfaction by utilizing machine learning classification models. By analyzing key features such as inflight service, seat comfort, flight distance, and customer demographics, the model classifies passengers as either satisfied 😊 or dissatisfied 😕. The insights gained from this project can help airlines enhance their services and improve overall customer experience.

📊 Dataset

The dataset includes various attributes that influence customer satisfaction, such as flight distance, seat comfort, inflight service quality, food and drink offerings, cleanliness, and whether the customer is a loyal or first-time traveler. These features provide a comprehensive view of factors affecting satisfaction levels, enabling the model to make accurate predictions.

🧪 Models and Evaluation

Multiple machine learning models were implemented, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). These models were evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to determine their effectiveness in predicting customer satisfaction. The Random Forest model stood out by delivering the best results with high accuracy and robust performance.

📈 Results

After training and evaluating the models, the Random Forest model provided the most reliable predictions. It effectively handled the diverse features of the dataset, making it a suitable choice for predicting customer satisfaction. The model's robustness and accuracy highlight its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

💡 Future Enhancements

Future improvements could involve hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance further. Additionally, exploring advanced models like Gradient Boosting and XGBoost could enhance the prediction accuracy. Deploying the final predictor as an interactive web application using Flask or Streamlit would also make the tool accessible to a broader audience.
